				<p> After the successes of their albums Pablo Honey and The Bends, the band knew they wanted to do something
				that would set them apart from the rest. Taking a break and Isolating themselves from socitey, the band decided to create a concept album to set themselves apart from all the other Alternative acts at the time. OK Computer changed the complete music landscape and shattered expectations from everyone, pusing the boundaries of Rock and Music.
				As the years past, OK Computer has aged like fine wine and has semented itself as one of, if not the greatest
				albums of all time. <br> <br> From the title, the album mainly focuses on the slow growth and development of technology, how we start to adapt technology, and the overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety, as our world begins to change for the better or for worse. In the present, this album has almost predicted the future, as we all rely on these very technologies in our daily lives, and it's almost impossible to imagine a world without it. <br> <br>
				The music of OK Computer feels surreal and melancholy, with the tasteful use of distortion and effects, the albums feels like it came from another planet. The lyrics reflect the same feeling with Thom Yorke's unique delivery and writing. <br> <br>
				<b> Notable Songs: </b> <br>
				<h2> Airbag </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp The Album's Intro song Airbag is the track most like their previous work, with highly distorted guitars and drums, this feels like your normal radiohead song with a bit of electronic flair. Thom's lyrics talk about how an airbag saved his life and how this made him felt born again. <br>
				<h2> Paranoid Android </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp Considered one of the best songs of the album. Paranoid Android gives us more of that electric and melancholic feel of the album, with the music feels layered around you with different guitars and synths. The lyrics describe the feeliing of dullness and how people don't try to stand out which is in contrast to the next song.
				<h2> Subterranean Homesick Alien </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp This song feels spacious and looming in contrast with Paranoid Android. The drums in the backgound gives a feeling of familiarity whilst the distant synths and guitars give you the feeling of alienation. This song speaks about the feeling of isolation and alienation from society.
				<h2> Let Down </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp The fifth track Let Down might be one of my favorite songs of all time. It has this amazing mix of feeling from sadness from the layers of strings slowly building up and looming around you while thom yorke delivers this heart fealt and gut wrenching lyrics. As the song progresses this feeling of sadness slowly turns into hope, and as the strings slowly feel more lively and the synths give way to the final verse where Thom delivers this lyrics with feeling of peace and acceptance.
				<h2> Climbing Up the Walls </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp Climbing up the walls is an eerie song in a good way. The distorted drums and vocals gives the song a feeling of unfamiliarity, with these weird distant ringing and echoing that adds to the sense of fear that the verses have. Add to that the heavy distorted guitar and that makes this track feel emotional and yet so unique and unknown.
				<h2> No Surprises </h2>
				&nbsp &nbsp The Tenth track; No Suprises is the biggest song in this album and for good reason. The song is just beautifully melancholic. It's depressing but in a good way. Unlike most other songs on the album, the star of the show are the strings, a simple xylophone like instrument, and the lyrics giving this feeling of a sad lullaby. With Thom's vocals and lyrics giving out this feeling of fear and dread that makes for a beautiful yet depressing masterpiece.
				<br> <br>
				The album is just a masterpiece, it breaks the mold, it makes you feel, and the soundscape is absolutely gorgeous. This album has stood the test of time and has aged gracefully. OK Computer is a must listen for every music enthusiast and I recommend this albnum to everyone.
