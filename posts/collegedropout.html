				<p> &nbsp Out of nowhere from the 2000s comes this producer with a dream. Kanye West's debut album The College dropout broke the mold and changed the landscape of Hip-hop music forever. In a genre dominated by hard gangster rap shaped by rough upbringings and street life of california, comes this kid from Chicago with a knack for production wanting to make it in the industry. The result, a Fun, creative, unique and relatable Hip-hop album unlike anything before.
				<br> <br>
				&nbsp Despite the Kanye's eventual spiraling, mental struggles and insanity, this man used to just be a kid with a dream and passion for Hip-hop. The theme of the album, college and young adulthood resonates with a lot of people includeing me. each song tackles different subjects that speaks to this young Kanye and you can feel the genuine passion for music that he pours into each of the tracks.
				<br> <br>
				<b> Notable Songs: </b> <br>
				<h2> We Dont Care </h2>
				&nbsp We Don't Care is a fun, carefree feeling song that starts off the album with a bang. Despite it's unserious nature, the topics tackled in the song are actual problems that is faced by many people, the struggles of trying to get by, getting education, earning a living by any means necessary, and being judged for those very actions.
				<h2> All Falls Down </h2>
				&nbsp One of the biggest songs of the album, All falls down showcases Kanye's lyricism, telling a story about the problems that faces society, especially for the african american community. With a catchy chorus from a Lauryn Hill sample that was rerecorded by Syleena Johnson, the song is catchy and the performance is heartfelt.
				<h2> Spaceship </h2>
				&nbsp My personal favorite in the album, Spaceship shocases Kanye's sampling chops and his ability to create amazing soundscapes without much effort. Added to this are his very own vocal soft performance singing in the chorus. The song's subject tackles the hardships and exhausting cycle of having to work long hours just to get by. This song gives a feeling of a light of hope to a tunnel that seems endless.
				<h2> Jesus Walks </h2>
				&nbsp One of the most unique Hip-hop songs, Jesus Walks is a rap song... about Jesus. Somehow, this song conveys the message without feeling cringe or weird. The production on this song is absolutely top notch, it gives a feeling of a church choir, a marching band and a gangster rap song all at the same time. It's motivation, and inspiring, similar to the song after.
				<h2> Never Let Me Down </h2>
				&nbsp Never Let Me Down features Kanye's Iconic chipmunk soul sample that gives the song a triumpanth and inspiring sound, combined with the lyricism from Jay-Z and Kanye. It's an uplifting song that makes you feel like you can conquer the world.
				<h2> Slow Jamz </h2>
				&nbsp Slow Jamz is a Soul, R&B and Hip-hop hybrid that does everything so well. Jamie Foxx's simple lyrics and vocals gives the song a classic feeling whilst the Rapping performance from Kanye and Twista gives you that high upbeat feel. This mix of Slow and Fast pacing is masterfully done and the song flows together perfectly.
				<h2> Through The Wire </h2>
				&nbsp Kanye's determination and passion for music in this song is through the wire, literally and metaphorically. Not even a car accident, and a wired shut jaw can stop the creativity that comes out of this man's brain. Featuring the iconi soul sample, through the wire is just a fun feel good song with a very unique concept behind it.
				<h2> Family Business </h2>
				&nbsp Wholesome, describes the song the best. Family Business is such a heartwarming song that just gives you the feeling of big family get together. The simple piano riffs and the storytelling in this song feels close to home, and there's no home without your family.
				<h2> Last Call </h2>
				&nbsp Last Call is the victory march of the album. This song gives the feeling of winning, as kanye raps about his journey to follow his dream and succeed. The latter part of the song tells the story of the struggles he faced and his inspiring journey till the creation of the album.
				<br> <br>
				The College Dropout is just good at everything, every song feels unique and enjoyable. It's not an album for everyone, but it's an album that has a little bit of everything. This album is such an infuential album for the expansion of Hip-hop into the mainstream leading to artists like tyler the creator shaping the landscape of hip-hop today.
